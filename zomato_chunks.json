The section below shares key highlights of our progress on each of our sustainability themes. For more details, please refer to the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report on page 71 of this report. 1 Climate conscious deliveries At the beginning of FY24, we set ourselves the goal of achieving Net Zero emissions across our food delivery value chain by 2033. The table below highlights the progress we have made so far in FY24. Carbon reduction target Actions and commitments We maintained 100% of our scope 1 & scope 2 emissions Maintain Scope 1 and i at zero through use of an equivalent amount of verified Scope 2 emissions at carbon removal offsets and International Renewable zero Energy Certificates (IRECs) Our last-mile delivery emissions on a per km basis reduced by Reduce last mile delivery ii 9.4% in FY24 compared to FY2 emissions by 70% on a per km basis by FY30 This reduction was largely facilitated by the growing share of EV- from a base year of FY22 based deliveries In FY24, ~8% of our food delivery orders were delivered using This target is aligned with our EVs (4x YoY growth) commitment to facilitate 100% EV-based deliveries by 2030 In addition, our Hyperpure business has also been steadily ramping up the use of EVs for deliveries. In FY24, ~20% of Hyperpure orders were delivered via EVs. 2 Waste Free World Our voluntary initiatives to address waste generated by food delivery orders are driven by the principle of \u2018reduce, recycle an", "Y24, ~20% of Hyperpure orders were delivered via EVs. 2 Waste Free World Our voluntary initiatives to address waste generated by food delivery orders are driven by the principle of \u2018reduce, recycle and reward\u2019. Initiatives launched prior to FY24 were indexed towards the \u2018reduce\u2019 and \u2018recycle\u2019 aspects of this principle whereas initiatives launched during FY24 focused more on the \u2018reward\u2019 aspect. The table below highlights our key existing and new initiatives aimed at waste reduction and our progress on these initiatives during FY24. 29Company Overview: ESG update | Statutory Reports | Financial Statements Initiatives and progress \u2018Don\u2019t send cutlery\u2019 initiative Starting Aug-21, \u2018don\u2019t send cutlery\u2019 is set as the default option on the food delivery app unless customers explicitly opt-in for cutler Reduce In FY24, this initiative led to a 75% reduction in Orders with cutlery, thereby preventing ~933 MT of cutlery waste 100% Plastic neutral deliveries Starting Apr-22, Zomato committed to voluntarily recycle more than 100% of all plastic utilized in the packaging of food delivery Orders So far, we have recycled 30,000 MT of plastic waste equivalent to 1.5x1 the Recycle estimated amount of plastic used by our restaurant partners for Orders placed on our platform.

During FY24, FI partnered with the government to design systemic interventions to reduce hunger among underserved communities in India. As part of these interventions, FI expanded the scale of its existing initiatives and piloted new ones. Key highlights include Daily Feeding Program (DFP): FI operates one of India\u2019s largest non-government feeding programs in schools serving 1.2+ lakh daily meals to children studying in low-income affordable schools. DFP helps underserved children get access to the right nutrition during formative years which is critical for their holistic development. In FY24, FI served 1.3+ crore meals across 500+ schools and educational center Partnering with the Government: Worked with the government to help improve food security for 25,000+ undernourished children across 4 districts \u2013 Varanasi, Gurugram, Etah and Kushinagar leading to improvement in school attendance within these Anganwadi areas Note As per an independent external assessment 30Company Overview: ESG update | Statutory Reports | Financial Statements 4 Inclusive growth We continuously look for ways to positively impact the lives of our delivery partners and sustainability of our restaurant partners in our food delivery business.

We also help generate earning opportunities for our delivery partners who typically comprise of independent gig economy workers. In FY24, we committed to two new goals to further empower small businesses and gig workers: 1 Support the growth of 300k+ micro, small 2 Enhance the earning and saving capacity of 1 and medium restaurant businesses and million gig workers through upskilling, food entrepreneurs by 2030 partnerships and benefit programs by 2030 In our quick commerce business, we created earning opportunities not just for 67k monthly active delivery partners, but also for 20,000+ workers including 600+ women workers across our warehousing and store supply chain. We continue to generate earning opportunities for local entrepreneurs and small retailers that manage store operations for us in multiple locations. We also work with local manufacturers and emerging consumer brands to expand their footprint across multiple regions in India. 5 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion As part of our commitment to provide equal opportunities to everyone across our value chain, we announced a goal to achieve a minimum of 50% aggregate representation of diverse groups - women, LGBTQIA+, persons with disability (PwDs), veterans, and other historically disadvantaged groups in our employee base and Board of Directors by 2030. We have made some early progress towards this goal. Women representation in our workforce improved largely driven by a 9% decline in female attrition and 10% increase in retention rate for returning mothers. We also received the Economic Times Award for \u2018Best Organizations for Women\u2019 in FY24. Our efforts to promote diversity and equity is not limited to our employees only but also extends to stakeholders across our value chain.

We had 9% representation as of Mar-24 31Company Overview: ESG update | Statutory Reports | Financial Statements 6 Health, safety and wellbeing for all We made significant progress towards on-road safety of our delivery partners. We launched a unique \u2018first-responder training program\u2019 in FY24, where delivery partners are trained in medical first aid & CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) through professional and certified training programs. This program has garnered enthusiastic participation from delivery partners on our platform. Delivery partners are voluntarily enrolling in this program, recognizing the importance of timely first aid interventions that can potentially save lives of all road users. As at Mar-24, ~19k delivery partners have been trained as emergency first responders. Additionally, we have been building a proprietary network of 600+ on- ground weather stations that provides precise and real-time data on key weather parameters such as temperature, wind speed, rainfall, etc. This network was created by us to help us make informed business decisions and better serve our customers and delivery partners under various climatic conditions. Given the significant potential impact of this data across multiple weather-related use cases for enterprises and research institutes, as a Zomato giveback, we have made this data freely accessible to anyone who wishes to leverage it through an API available on weatherunion", "r-related use cases for enterprises and research institutes, as a Zomato giveback, we have made this data freely accessible to anyone who wishes to leverage it through an API available on weatherunion.com. We also expanded the coverage for some of the initiatives launched in the past - The Shelter Project - Launched in FY23, The Shelter Project provides all gig workers access to rest points where they can take a break during deliveries and get access to basic amenities. During FY24, we scaled the geographic presence of this initiative. As of Mar-24, Zomato operated a network of 373 rest points across the country Emergency Ambulance Response - During FY24, we helped 1,358 delivery partners get access to medical help in case of on-road emergencies. By Mar-24, average response time of our emergency ambulance network had improved to <15 minutes Insurance benefits for delivery partners - Insurance with accident cover up to INR 10 lakhs, health cover up to INR 1 lakh, loss of pay coverage and maternity insurance up to INR 40k As part of our delivery partner welfare initiatives, we also started to facilitate scholarships for children of eligible delivery partners through funds raised from independent donors. As at the end of Mar-24, 150 K-12 scholarships and 100 test preparation scholarships had been given to children of delivery partners through a merit-based open assessment from donations raised. 32Company Overview: ESG update | Statutory Reports | Financial Statements 7 Customer centricity We launched several customer-centric innovations in FY24 to improve the accessibility, affordability, assortment and quality of food towards our goal of serving the next billion consumers across food ordering, delivery and dining-out. Our major service innovations include Zomato Everyday, Zomato Legends, Large order fleet, Food on Train and the Healthy section (described in detail earlier in this report).

Our behind-the-scenes improvements to customer experience include building proprietary geo-location technology that has resulted in a significant decrease in drop location errors. Automation of customer service has also reduced the in-app query resolution time significantly. These improvements in the quality of customer experience are core building blocks for our future growth. 8 Governance Our governance goal is to maintain high standards of corporate governance to protect the interests of all our stakeholders. As a technology platform, a key area of focus for us is cybersecurity and data privacy. In the last fiscal year, we secured ISO 27001 certification for our Information Security Management Systems. In FY24, our focus has been on preparing our systems for compliance with the Digital Protection and Data Privacy Act 2023. We also strengthened our internal employee training systems to support our compliance programs.

Income Consolidated revenue from operations increased 71% YoY to INR 12,114 crore in FY24. Revenue growth was driven by growth across all four of our key businesses (food delivery, quick commerce, Going-out and B2B supplies). a) Food delivery revenue from operations grew 40% YoY to INR 6,361 crore in FY24 from INR 4,533 crore in FY23, driven by a 23% YoY increase in GOV and expansion in commission take rate. Starting Q2FY24, we introduced a platform fee which contributed towards take-rate expansion. Ad income grew faster than GOV driven by (i) increase in ad inventory on our platform and, (ii) increase in average ad spends per advertiser. (Note: Food delivery revenue as per the financial statements is different from the food delivery Adjusted Revenue that we have presented on page 2 and page 13 as that also includes the customer delivery charges that we collect on behalf of delivery partners from customers and platform fee paid by the customers in the food delivery business (that is not already included in revenue). Adjusted Revenue is a metric tracked by the management to analyse the business performance. Refer page 39 for the reconciliation between consolidated Adjusted Revenue and revenue from operations.) b) Hyperpure revenue more than doubled to INR 3,172 crore (111% YoY growth) in FY24, driven by growth in both the core restaurant supplies business and the newer quick commerce opportunity that we started tapping into in FY23. On the core restaurant side, growth was driven by increase in unique restaurants served by Hyperpure and growth in revenue per restaurant. c) Quick commerce", "unity that we started tapping into in FY23. On the core restaurant side, growth was driven by increase in unique restaurants served by Hyperpure and growth in revenue per restaurant. c) Quick commerce revenue is not comparable between FY23 and FY24 as consolidation of Blinkit financials in FY23 is from 10-Aug-22 onwards (transaction closing date). Based on the proforma numbers for FY23 presented on page 17 of this annual report, quick commerce Revenue grew 116% YoY from INR 1,063 crore in FY23 to INR 2,301 crore in FY24 largely driven by the 93% YoY growth in GOV. Overall take-rate also increased to 18.5% in FY24 from 16.5% in FY23 driven by all three revenue levers - higher commissions, better ad monetization and higher customer delivery charges. d) Going-out business grew 51% YoY to INR 258 crore from INR 171 crore in FY23, largely driven by growth in the India dining-out business. Our events and ticketing business is still nascent with a large untapped opportunity ahead. For reference, we started reporting \u2018Going-out\u2019 as a separate business segment in our financials from Q2FY24 onwards. Going-out includes our dining-out business (India + UAE) and our nascent ticketing business. We have provided like-to-like prior period numbers for comparison. Other income increased by INR 165 crore to INR 847 crore in FY24 primarily due to increase in treasury income. This growth was driven by increase in investable cash balance and increase in overall yields as we indexed a higher share of our investments towards debentures and bonds as compared to bank deposits. 36Company Overview | Statutory Reports: MD&A | Financial Statements B. Expenses Cost of goods sold (COGS) increased by INR 1,487 crore (107% YoY) to INR 2,882 crore in FY24. COGS primarily relates to the Hyperpure business and grew in line with Hyperpure Revenue growth. Hyperpure gross margin improved YoY largely due to better sourcing and growing mix of high margin categories. In the core restaurant supply business, w", " and grew in line with Hyperpure Revenue growth. Hyperpure gross margin improved YoY largely due to better sourcing and growing mix of high margin categories. In the core restaurant supply business, we increased the minimum order value threshold below which restaurants are not allowed to place orders. This led to churn of smaller unprofitable customers and increase in average order value which resulted in better profitability. Employee benefits expenses increased by INR 194 crore (13% YoY), to INR 1,659 crore in FY24. This primarily includes salaries, wages, bonuses and share-based compensation paid to our on-roll employees across all our businesses. Growth was largely driven by increase in salaries and wages due to increments and increase in overall headcount which grew 34% to 8,244 in FY24 from 6,173 in FY23. Share-based payment expense remained similar YoY at INR 516 crore in FY24 vis-\u00e0-vis INR 505 crore in FY23. Finance Costs increased 47% YoY to INR 72 crore in FY24. This primarily includes interest on lease liabilities recorded under Ind AS 116 which increased YoY as Blinkit store network scaled to 526 stores by Mar-24 from 377 stores in Mar-23. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by INR 89 crore (20% YoY) to INR 526 crore in FY24. This includes (i) depreciation on fixed assets, (ii) depreciation as recorded under Ind AS 116 and (iii) amortization of intangible assets.

If Yes, then provide details. Yes. In FY23, we committed to achieving net zero emissions across our food ordering and delivery value chain by 2033 from FY22 base year. We have submitted our commitment to Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), and are in process of getting the targets validated. Towards achieving this long-term goal, we\u2019ve set the following targets: \u2022 Maintain scope 1 & scope 2 emissions at 0 from FY23 onwards \u2022 Reduce last mile delivery emissions by 70% on a per km basis by FY30 from the base year of FY22. This target is aligned with our commitment to facilitate 100% EV-based deliveries by 2030, our flagship GHG reduction project. Against the above targets, our performance to date is summarised below: \u2022 We have maintained 100% of our scope 1 & scope 2 emissions at 0 through use of an equivalent amount of verified carbon removal offsets and International Renewable Energy Certificates (IRECs). \u2022 Our last-mile delivery emissions on a per km basis reduced by 9.35% in FY24 when compared to FY22. The reduction in last-mile delivery emissions was facilitated by an expansion of our EV program. FY24, Zomato\u2019s total EV- based food deliveries increased by 4x from previous year, totaling to 61.6 million orders, representing 8.19% of total orders.

At Zomato, we are committed to implementing effective waste management strategies to minimise the environmental impact of our business. Our employees sit out of leased premises or co-working spaces where waste disposal is managed by the owners or main lessors of the property. In offices that are directly leased by us, we have implemented initiatives to reduce waste and promote segregation at the source. \u2022 To reduce waste, we have replaced disposable cutlery with reusable plates and cutlery and implemented a \u2018bring your own bottle\u2019 initiative eliminating the use of paper cups for drinking water. \u2022 To promote segregation at source we utilise appropriately coloured and labelled dustbins to facilitate easy and efficient separation of various types of waste, ensuring that recyclable, organic, and non- recyclable materials are appropriately sorted by our own housekeeping teams. For e-waste, biomedical waste and hazardous waste streams, we take responsibility for appointing authorised waste management vendors and collect recycling certificates from them. For plastic waste, wet waste and paper and cardboard waste streams, we collect details of disposal and recycling from vendors appointed by our landlords or owners of the premises. Along with our policies, these processes have earned our Gurugram and Bengaluru offices ISO 14001 certification in the reporting year. Since, we are a technology platform in the services business, our generation of hazardous waste is minimal and toxic waste nil. To further reduce the impact of waste generated by orders placed by users from restaurants on Zomato\u2019s platform, we have implemented a number of voluntary initiatives. One of our key voluntary waste reduction initiatives is the \u2018don\u2019t send cutlery\u2019 initiative on the food delivery app, which requires end-users to explicitly \u2018opt-in\u2019 for cutlery, if needed.

This initiative has resulted in a reduction of restaurant orders sent with cutlery by more than 75%, preventing the usage of single-use materials and reducing an estimated 933 MT of cutlery waste for FY24. In the domain of recycling, a major voluntary initiative we have taken is \u2018100% Plastic Neutral deliveries\u2019. While the choice of packaging used for food deliveries rests with our restaurant partners, we are committed to mitigating the impact of this packaging on the environment through voluntary recycling. Towards this end, Zomato voluntarily recycled 10,000 MT of plastic waste in FY24. Since April 2022, we\u2019ve recycled 30,000 MT of plastic waste which is more than 1.5x the estimated amount of plastic used by our restaurants for packaging orders as per an independent external assessment. 11.

The Group recognises impairment, when the carrying amount of CGUs including goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of CGU. The Group\u2019s CGUs containing goodwill are as follows: 1. India food ordering and delivery (Goodwill: INR 1,209 crores) 2. Blink Commerce Private Limited (\u201cBCPL\u201d) (Goodwill: INR 3,507 crores) The recoverable value of India food ordering and delivery CGU is determined based on the market value of the Company.The recoverable value of BCPL CGU is estimated based on the discounted cash flows method. The significant unobservable inputs used in the estimation of recoverable value are discount rate and terminal growth rate. The discount rate used for such computations is the weighted average cost of capital of the Company which contain such CGU.

The Group\u2019s primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance. Risk management is carried out by senior management for cash and cash equivalent, trade receivable, investments, deposits with banks, foreign currency risk exposure and liquidity risk. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. The Group ensures optimisation of cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices. i) Interest rate risk I nterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group\u2019s investments are predominantly held in government securities, debenture or bonds, bank deposits and mutual funds. 234Company Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements: Consolidated ", ". The Group\u2019s investments are predominantly held in government securities, debenture or bonds, bank deposits and mutual funds. 234Company Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements: Consolidated Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 CIN : L93030DL2010PLC198141 Investment in bank deposits and certain government securities are measured at amortised cost and are fixed interest rate bearing instruments and hence not subject to interest rate volatility. The Group also invests in mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses, such investments are susceptible to market interest risks which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, given the relatively short tenure of underlying portfolio of the mutual fund schemes in which the Group has invested, such risk is not significant. Investments in debenture or bonds and certain government securities are subject to interest rate risk which are fair valued through other comprehensive income to recognise market volatility. Sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates: (INR crores) Financial asset Exposure % change in Change in fair value Change in fair value input during the year ended during the year ended March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Debenture or bonds 5,723 (+)1 (169) (1) Government securities 2,467 (+)1 (102) - A reduction in interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect on the Group\u2019s financial statements. ii) Foreign currency risk F oreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group\u2019s exposure to foreign currencies is negligible, with the exception of the AED, where the net exposure amounts to INR 1 crore (March 31, 2023: INR 2 crores).

The Company\u2019s primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance. Risk management is carried out by senior management for cash and cash equivalent, trade receivable, investments, deposits with banks, foreign currency risk exposure and liquidity risk. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flo", "h and cash equivalent, trade receivable, investments, deposits with banks, foreign currency risk exposure and liquidity risk. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. The Company ensures optimisation of cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices. 342Company Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements: Standalone Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 CIN : L93030DL2010PLC198141 i) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company\u2019s investments are predominantly held in government securities, debenture or bonds, bank deposits and mutual funds. Investment in bank deposits and certain government securities are measured at amortised cost and are fixed interest rate bearing instruments and hence not subject to interest rate volatility. The Company also invests in mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses, such investments are susceptible to market interest risks which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, given the relatively short tenure of underlying portfolio of the mutual fund schemes in which the Company has invested, such risk is not significant. Investments in debenture or bonds and certain government securities are subject to interest rate risk which are fair valued through other comprehensive income to recognise market volatility. Sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates: (INR crores) Financial asset Exposure % change Change in fair Change in fair in input value during the value during the year ende", "ate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates: (INR crores) Financial asset Exposure % change Change in fair Change in fair in input value during the value during the year ended year ended March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Debenture or bonds 5,723 (+)1 (169) (1) Government securities 2,467 (+)1 (102) - A reduction in interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect on the company\u2019s financial statements. ii) Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company\u2019s exposure to foreign currencies is negligible, with the exception of the AED, where the net exposure amounts to 0 crore (March 31, 2023: 1 crore). The Company keeps a regular track of all the changes in foreign currency rates to monitor and manage this foreign currency risk. Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to INR 77 crores (March 31, 2023: INR 84 crores). Trade receivables are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers primarily located in India and Middle East. Credit risk has always been managed by the Company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. On account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the Company uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain. The Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account available external and internal credit risk factors such as the Company\u2019s historical experience for customers and adjusted for forward-looking information. The Company has esta", "trix takes into account available external and internal credit risk factors such as the Company\u2019s historical experience for customers and adjusted for forward-looking information. The Company has established an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The management uses a simplified approach for the purpose of computation of expected credit loss for trade receivables and 12 months expected credit loss for other receivables further an impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major parties. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly and closely monitored. Basis historical trend, the Company provides for any outstanding beyond 180 days. The trade receivables on the respective reporting dates are 343Company Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements: Standalone Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 CIN : L93030DL2010PLC198141 net off the allowance which is sufficient to cover the entire lifetime loss of sales recognised including those that are currently less than 180 days outstanding. The Company has made investments in government securities which carries sovereign rating and debenture or bonds which are rated AAA; which do not have a default history. The Company\u2019s treasury maintains its cash and cash equivalents and deposits \u2013 with banks, financial and other institutions, having a good reputation and past track record which are considered to carry a low credit risk. Similarly, counterparties of the Company\u2019s other receivables carry either negligible or very low credit risk. Further, the Company reviews the creditworthiness of the counter-parties on the basis of its ratings and financial strength for all the above assets on an ongoing basis and if required, takes necessary mitigation measures. The Company has established an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of inve", "e assets on an ongoing basis and if required, takes necessary mitigation measures. The Company has established an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of investments in debt instruments. The management uses a 12 months expected credit loss approach after taking into account the time value of money and other reasonable information available as a result of past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. For trade receivable ageing, refer note 43. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time. The Company has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Company\u2019s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity requirements. The Company\u2019s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived.
