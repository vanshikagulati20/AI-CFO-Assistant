We are pleased to report another year of significant growth for TechCorp Innovations. Fiscal year 2024 was marked by the successful launch of our 'Synapse AI' platform, which has already seen remarkable adoption in the enterprise market. Despite global economic headwinds, our strategic focus on cloud solutions and AI-driven analytics has yielded strong financial results. We achieved a record revenue of ₹8,500 Crore, a substantial increase from the previous year.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Financial Performance
Our financial performance in FY2024 reflects our strong market position. Total revenue grew by 25% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by a 40% growth in our Cloud Services division. Our legacy software division saw a modest growth of 5%.

Profitability also saw a significant turnaround. We moved from a net loss in the previous year to a healthy profit after tax of ₹1,200 Crore in FY2024. This was achieved through disciplined cost management and scaling our high-margin cloud offerings.
